Hi Andy!

If you are reading this, it means you successfully cloned the ALightRoom repository to your computer. Git works differently than perforce in that you "clone" the entire repository to your computer. You checkout files and do all your branching/merging right there, and then PUSH the entire repository back to the depot. This allows you to make all sorts of crazy branches locally, offline, and only push things to the site when you are ready. Obviously cloning an entire repository (and all it's history) doesn't work well for large binary files, which is why they use perforce for game development. But for fast development in the real world, like for websites and javascript stuff, people use git.

ProjectName: ALightRoom
GameDesign: Adventure game
Team: RustedApple and OrangeKyo
SourceControl: Git
HostingSite: Assembla
Tech: Javascript + HTML

Here are some links to get you started:

Git for windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/
Git getting started: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup

Assemble site. Sign up for an account here: https://app.assembla.com/
Assembla Repository URL:  git@git.assembla.com:alightroom.git
Assembla "Getting started w/ Git" instructions: https://app.assembla.com/spaces/alightroom/git/instructions

Use these commands in "Git Bash" to set up your git configuration + ssh key. You only have to do this stuff once.
   git config --global user.name "RustedApple"
   git config --global user.email rustedapple@yahoo.com
   git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession"
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "rustedapple@yahoo.com" // Add this generated key to your profile on Assembla. This is how hackers can't get into our shit.

Then open "Git GUI" > Clone Repository.
   Source Location: git@git.assembla.com:alightroom.git
   Target Directory: Wherever
