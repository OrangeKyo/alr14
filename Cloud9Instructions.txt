cloud 9's version of a gui version for git
https://root-project.org/2014/07/09/work/ungit-on-cloud9/

git commands I use for cloud9

git fetch
git merge
git commit -m "things you changed here"
git push
(tutorial said to use git push -u origin master, but git push seemed to work for me - maybe you can clarify that)

I'm not sure if this is necessary, but I cloned repo in git gui to our new github home
https://github.com/rustedapple/alr14.git

So I'm slowly trying to grasp, but I guess github is the intermediary between our notepad++/sublime stuff we wanna do on our local machines and the online cloud changes we do on cloud9.  Kinda like best of both worlds hopefully.
