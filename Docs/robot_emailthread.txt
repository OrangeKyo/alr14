> It's very... strange.  But I've been quite enjoying this weird sorta-civ, sorta-idle game.  Has a lot more depth to it than your average web game.

> Even several hundred years into game time, I still sometimes get a little too incautious about trading away all my catnip or rebalancing my workers.... just lost my entire village earlier today.  Fortunately you can bounce back from that pretty easily but the built up experience / skill loss starts to hurt.

> You probably need to assign more kittens to farming.  Eventually you get enough techs and raw farms that that is less of a risk (unless you foolishly trade away all your catnip right before winter, which I have done more than once).

At 12 kittens, I usually leave my computer with 1 kitten to each job except farming where I stack the rest.  If I don't have enough even then for a tough winter, I get rid of a woodcutter or miner since those are less critical and you can convert catnip into wood. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under food production I see Catnip field (21), I assume that means I have 21 kittens farming, and I cannot keep 4 other kittens alive

You should be able to click on the "settlement" tab and see a screen where you can assign your kittens to jobs.

Year 129 update -

My population of 24 apparently immortal kittens is building a culture. I'm pretty sure they put the Cult in culture, actually. The godless heathens. They can't build a temple because they keep walking all over the manuscripts.

Unrelated, I seem to have hit a point of critical 'hurry up and wait' mass. I can't do much until my resources are full, so I leave it alone, then spend everything all at once, and then hurry up and wait some more.
